## Description

![Post editor screenshot](screenshot.png)

The plugin harmonises the appearance of posts in the admin post editor with the native Bootstrap appearance.

Specifically, it loads two stylesheets onto post-edit pages:

* Bootstrap 5.1.3 https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
* A CSS file, editor.css, contained in the plugin directory, which only applies some extra margin to the post editor interior.

This does not mean the post editor is empowered with Bootstrap components.

It also won't necessarily make posts in the post editor appear as they do on the front-end, which is a separate matter.

Rather, this plugin  makes posts in the post editor look like plain Bootstrap.
